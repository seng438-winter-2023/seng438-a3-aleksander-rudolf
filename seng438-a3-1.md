# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we explored white-box testing, specifically coverage-based testing, and explored coverage tools to explore branch, line and method coverage. We used EclEmma, an extension built-in to Eclipse that is a coverage tool. This tool allowed us to explore the coverage of our test suite from assignment 2 and allowed us to improve upon that test suite to obtain acceptable coverage for the following categories: 90% for statement coverage, 70% for branch coverage, and 60% for conditional coverage. We also got familiar with measuring the data flow coverage manually and drawing data flow graphs.
